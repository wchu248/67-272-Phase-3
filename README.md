67272 Chess Store Project: Phase 3 Starter
===

This is the starter code for Phase 3 of the [67-272 Chess Store Project](http://67272.cmuis.net/projects).  This starter code includes all models needed for this phase and passing unit tests for those models.

In addition, this starter code includes functional tests for the controllers and [cucumber tests](https://cucumber.io/) for acceptance testing.  In this phase you will write controllers and views so that these tests all pass (and the unit tests still pass and have 100 percent test coverage). Passing all these tests is not totally sufficient for a top-rate application, but you will earn the vast majority of the points for the project by just passing these tests.

You will need to run `bundle install` to get the needed testing gems.  The installers for `cucumber` and `simple_form` have already been run when we created our solution and they have been left intact for your convenience. Do not modify anything in the features directory or in the test/controllers directory, but even if you do, know that we will be replacing your contents with ours before grading in part to be sure no one is trying to pull a fast one with a revised test suite that always passes.

You can populate the development database with realistic data by first running `rake db:migrate` and then `rake dp:populate`.
