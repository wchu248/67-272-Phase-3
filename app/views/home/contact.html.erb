<p>	<%= image_tag 'contact.jpg', class: "left" %>Unfortunately, Alex and Mark's
    Chess Store is not a real online website, but rather a project for 
    programming students at Carnegie Mellon University. We are sure that you 
    wanted to buy some chess items from the absolute best chess players on the 
    planet, but that's how it goes sometimes. We apologize for this, and if you 
    would like to contact someone about it, here is the contact info:</p>
